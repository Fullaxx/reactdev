sudo docker run -it --rm --name rdev -h rdev -p 3000:3000 fullaxx/reactdev /bin/bash

cd /opt
npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app mediafe

cd mediafe
npm start

Success! Created mediafe at /opt/mediafe
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build (and npm run server)
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can√¢t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd mediafe
  npm start

Happy hacking!
